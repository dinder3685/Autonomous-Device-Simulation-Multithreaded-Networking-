Name: Autonomous Device Simulation (Multithreaded & Networking)

Description:
This project simulates an autonomous system using multithreading and TCP/IP networking in C. It features multiple sensor simulations running in parallel and a TCP server for real-time data exchange.

Features:
âœ… Uses POSIX threads (pthread) for multithreading.
âœ… Simulates multiple sensors generating real-time data.
âœ… Implements a TCP/IP server for data communication.
âœ… Utilizes structs and dynamic memory allocation.
âœ… Designed for real-time embedded system simulations.

Technologies Used:

C Programming (Advanced concepts)
Multithreading (pthread)
TCP/IP Socket Programming
Dynamic Memory Management
