Name: Autonomous Device Simulation (Multithreaded & Networking)

Description:
This project simulates an autonomous system using multithreading and TCP/IP networking in C. It features multiple sensor simulations running in parallel and a TCP server for real-time data exchange.

Features:
✅ Uses POSIX threads (pthread) for multithreading.

✅ Simulates multiple sensors generating real-time data.

✅ Implements a TCP/IP server for data communication.

✅ Utilizes structs and dynamic memory allocation.

✅ Designed for real-time embedded system simulations.

Technologies Used:

C Programming (Advanced concepts)
Multithreading (pthread)
TCP/IP Socket Programming
Dynamic Memory Management

Future Improvements:

Add a client program to send data to the TCP server.

Implement data logging for sensor readings.

Improve sensor simulation with configurable parameters.
